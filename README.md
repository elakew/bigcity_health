# bigcity_health


In this project, I conducted data cleaning and created a visualization using a dataset published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Big Cities Health Inventory Coalition. This dataset, which is available on data.world and linked below, provides information about public health in the largest U.S. cities from 2003 to 2015. There are 34 health indicators, which includes 6 demographic-related factors, examined in this dataset. In the Juptyer file, I include comments detailing some of my choices and overall approach in analyzing this data. 

I completed this project in Python and employed the pandas and Matplotlib libraries. Thank you and enjoy!
