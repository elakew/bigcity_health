# bigcity_health


In this project, I conducted data cleaning and created a visualization using a dataset published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This dataset, which is available on data.world and linked below, provides information about the health status of the largest cities in the United States. There are 34 health indicators, which includes 6 demographic-related factors, examined in this dataset. In the Juptyer file, I include comments detailing some of my choices and overall approach in analyzing this data. Thank you and enjoy!
